### Java Generics Linear Algebra Library

This assignment is done to design a matrix and vector system that can hold Java Generics, allowing more flexibility than a traditional Java matrix from the Java API. It includes creation, access, and Matrix Operations (multiplication, addition, transposition). This also allows operations to be abstracted to the user level. More operations will be added.
